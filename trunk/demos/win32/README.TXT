 Each of the subdirectories contain fully functional applications
 which have been designed around NASMX's capabilities. Each one
 demonstrates the usage of this collection for the design of
 32-bit Windows applications. Below is a list of all current
 demonstration packages and their function.

  DEMO1  - Demonstrates basic usage.
  DEMO2  - Demonstrates the design of a simple window.
  DEMO3  - Demonstrates the use of a owner-drawn control.
  DEMO4  - Demonstrates a simple dialog based application.
  DEMO5  - Demonstrates a dialog application with user interaction.
  DEMO6  - Demonstrates an alternative message handling method.
  DEMO7  - Demonstrates the use of the StdWin.inc macros
  DEMO8  - Demonstrates the use of HL features such as do/while,
           do/until, and switch/case macros
  DEMO9  - Demonstrates how to create dynamically linked libraries and
           add them statically using the dllproc macro
  DEMO10 - Demonstrates the use of inline argument calling with proc
           and the use of the if/elsif/else/endif macros.
  DEMO11 - Demonstrates the use of the Standard C Library (MSVCRT)
           in a console mode program
  DEMO12 - Demonstrates the use of Win32 Console functions to achieve
           input, output and exiting from a console mode program
  DEMO13 - Demonstrates the use of nested structures and unions
  DEMO14 - Demonstrates using floating point variables
