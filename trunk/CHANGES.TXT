Archived Release: 9:30 PM 9/30/2007, by Keith Kanios
- Renamed project from "NASM32" to "NASMX" due to the
  inclusion of 64-bit material and cross-platform nature
  of the project.

- Revamped NASMX.INC to automatically detect object formats
  and "BITS" modes for seemless detection and use of INVOKE
  calling conventions.

- POLIB, POMAKE, PORC and POLINK have been removed in favor
  of GoLink and GoRC. GoLink supports Win64 linking.

- The Win32 DEMO batch files have been modified to reflect
  the use of GoLink and GoRC.

- The Windows installer no longer requires building the
  include and library files due to the nature and use of
  GoLink.

- The "def" and "lib" directories have been removed due to
  their obsolete nature.

- Added Win64 DEMOs 1 through 4.

- Added Linux syscall.inc in which employs the new SYSCALL
  macro that works similar to INVOKE for calling the Linux
  Kernel.

- Added Linux DEMO1 which illustrates SYSCALL usage for
  calling Linux Kernel functions.

- Changed Linux X11 DEMO1 to Destroy the Window and Close
  the Connection to X11 upon program exit.

- The "docs" directory has been deprecated and removed. All
  of the files that were in the "docs" directory have been
  placed in the root install directory.

- Added X11 DEMO1, an example of a basic X11 Window.

- Added partial X11 and Linux LibC include files only
  to support the X11 DEMO1. More complete versions
  will come later.

  GZIP Tarball compression format.

Archived Release: 7:03 AM 3/8/2007, by Keith Kanios
- Switched to using a compressed installation package.

- Added disclaimer the README.TXT file to help
  warn assembly language beginners become aware
  of the "basic" content of the packaged DEMOS.

- Removed tools from the BIN directory that were not
  vital to basic application development.

- Removed the DOS version of NASM (NASM.EXE) from the
  BIN directory, as this project has no direct intention
  of supporting the DOS environment. This also includes
  the removal of the DOS version of NDISASM (NDISASM.EXE)
  from the BIN directory as well.

- The 32-bit Windows NASM version (NASMW.EXE) has been
  renamed to simply NASM.EXE. This also includes the
  renaming of the 32-bit Windows NDISASM version
  (NDISASMW.EXE) to simply NDISASM.EXE as well.

- The Win32 and XBOX DEMO batch files have been changed
  to reflect the new layout/changes of the BIN directory.

Archived Release: 11:51 AM 2/16/2007, by Keith Kanios
- Added "def" directory for use with export
  definition files.

- Added Win32 export definition files to "def/win32".

- Developed and added DEF2INC program for creating all
  Win32 include files as this method allows for a smaller
  package download.

- Utilizing POLIB for creating all Win32 library
  files as this method allows for a smaller package
  download.

- Changed the layout of the "lib" directory to reflect
  future platform separation (i.e. Win32/Linux/etc...)

- Added DEMO12 to the list of Win32 example applications.
  Read the "README.TXT" file in the "demos/win32" directory
  for more information.

- Placed "stdwin.inc" back into the "inc/win32" subdirectory
  as it is Win32 API specific. DEMO7, DEMO8 and DEMO10 of
  the Win32 demos reflect this change.

- Added support for XBOX. Include file added ("xbe.inc") for
  development of XBE files directly from NASM. Include file
  added ("kernel.inc") to assist with XBOX Kernel calls.

- Added DEMO1 to the list of XBOX example applications.
  Read the "README.TXT" file in the "demos/xbox" directory
  for more information.

Archived Release: 2:13 AM 7/9/2006, by Keith Kanios and Bryant Keller
- Fixed string bug in INVOKE and cleaned-up
  obsolete symbols.

- Major rework done to give capatibility with
  The Win32ASM Project, which utilizes Pelle's Tools.
  Rewrote nasm32.inc to combine features from libc.mac,
  making a unifed nasm32.inc that will be the basis
  for future mutli-platform support.

- Forked Bryant's Demos for use on Win32 with Pelle's Tools,
  ALINK and GORC are no longer needed, or supported,
  in the package.

- Forked include and library files in preparation
  for multi-platform support. Win32 specific files can
  now be found in "win32" subdirectories. See the
  accompanying Win32 demos for usage.

  CHANGE: Renamed the "examples" directory to "demos".

  CHANGE: ALINK was removed from the package, in favor of
  POLINK support for the Win32 platform. This also removes
  the use of the OMF object format (-f obj) in favor of
  MS COFF (-f win32).

  CHANGE: GORC was removed from the package, in favor of
  PORC support for the Win32 platform.

Archived Release: 1:26 PM 3/10/2006, by Bryant Keller
- Added nasm32\macros\libc.mac which gives you
  the ability to build your applications using
  libc with ease. libc.mac _CANNOT_ be used with
  nasm32.inc because it contains the same macros,
  just for use with libc. This also means that
  Nasm32 can build applications on Linux/BSD systems
  which support gcc and libc.

Archived Release: 10:07 PM 2/13/2006, by Bryant Keller
- Added inline argument defining, similar to
  FASM and MASM, to the proc macro.

  NOTE: defining arguments inline means that
  the arguments are dword values by default.
  to define other sized arguments, use the
  old argd macro.

- Added if/elsif/else/endif macros for conditional
  assembly, as well as definitions for a cleaner
  syntax.

- Cleaned up the switch/case/default/break/endswitch
  macros to enable nested switch/case statments.

- Added a new demo, DEMO10 to show off inline
  argument defining using proc and to show how
  the if/elsif/else/endif macros work.

Archived Release: 6:46 PM 12/15/2005, by Bryant Keller
- Fixed a bug in the PROTO macro, added the
  dllproc macro, and included a demo on creating
  dynamically linked libraries.

Archived Release: 9:39 PM 12/12/2005, by Bryant Keller
- Added do/while, do/until, and switch/case
  support to the nasm32.inc include.

Archived Release: 10:47 PM 12/11/2005, by Bryant Keller
- Added many more include files to the
  /nasm32/inc directory. I've got most
  of the windows API completed in that
  aspect. I now have the wide character
  versions of each of the associated API's
  included as well for Unicode support

Archived Release: 6:12 PM 12/11/2005, by Bryant Keller
- Updated Demo7 to include all of the new
  'stdwin.inc' CreateWindowEx wrappers.

- Updated include file 'stdwin.inc' for the
  other standard controls that I left out.

  New Features:
   ComboCtl - Creates a standard combobox control
   ListBoxCtl - Creates a standard listbox control

Archived Release: 6:56 PM 12/10/2005, by Bryant Keller
- Added Demo7 to show off the new include
  file.

- New include file 'stdwin.inc' encapsulates
  CreateWindowEx calls to simplify the creation
  of windows and controls. (requires nasm32.inc)

  Features:
   StdWindow - Creates a standard SDI Window
   ButtonCtl - Creates a standard Button Control
   EditCtl - Creates a standard Edit Control
   StaticCtl - Creates a standard Static Control (centered text)

Archived Release: 3:24 AM 12/9/2005, by Bryant Keller
- Combined WinConst.Inc and WinStruct.Inc
  into Windows.Inc

- Changed icall to invoke to make it easier
  for people moving from Masm32

  Example:
   invoke GetModuleHandle
   invoke MessageBoxA, dword NULL, dword string, dword title, dword MB_OK

Archived Release: 2:25 PM 12/7/2005, by Bryant Keller
- Removed the xcall macro and set icall to handle
  routines with no arguments.

Archived Release: 4:44 PM 12/6/2005, by Bryant Keller
- This release is fully functional and contains
  six demo applications to show it's abilities.

- There is no resource compiler with this current
  release as I have not yet asked permission from
  any developers for the use, all software and
  source code is copywritten under the General
  Public License, just like the Netwide Assembler.
  (I used GoRC to compile the examples with resources)

- xcall should be used with routines which have no
  arguments, while icall should be used with routines
  which have arguments.

  Example:
   xcall GetModuleHandle
   icall MessageBoxA, dword NULL, dword string, dword title, dword MB_OK
